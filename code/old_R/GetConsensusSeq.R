#' @title Function for obtaining consensus sequence of DNA sequence symbols from a PWM matrix
#'
#' @description uses a special nomenclature (we call it the Logolas nomenclature)
#' to determine the consensus sequence of symbols based on the enrichment and
#' depletion of the symbols at each position. This approach is an alternative
#' to the getIUPAC() method used by the atSNP package.
#'
#' @param pwm The PWM table for a DNA sequence motif comprising of four bases, A, C
#' G, T.
#'
#' @return Returns the consensus sequence for the DNA sequence motif along the positions
#' using the Logolas nomenclature (highlighting both enrichment and depletion).
