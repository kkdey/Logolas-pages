Logo plots are popular in genomics for identifying transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. Popular logo plotting tools, such as seqLogo and motifStack, use a library of 4 symbols - A, C, G and T corresponding to 4 bases - to represent the TF binding motifs. While it is adequate for viewing TF binding signature profile, the limited size of the library of symbols makes it hard to extend the applicability of logo plots to other areas of genetics and beyond.

We propose a new R package called Logolas, which has a much wider library of logos comprising of all alphabets from A to Z, numbers from 0 to 9 and other symbols like dashes, arrows etc. Most importantly,  Logolas allows the user to easily combine the logo representations of these alphanumeric characters to create string logos. This enables the user to represent almost anything that can be written using alphanumerics, say methylation profile,  histone names,  protein amino acids, names of metagenomic/ecological taxa and also mutations (symbols like C->T, T->A etc). Additionally, Logolas provides a simple user interface where an user can build from scratch a logo for a symbol of her own choice and add it to the library. 

Besides the entropy based representation of enrichment of symbols commonly used inTF binding motifs, Logolas also presents an alternative representation aimed at highlighting both the enrichment and depletion of symbols, compared to the background, in each position of the signature pattern of a motif.

We show a number of applications of Logolas to demonstrate how it can be used for visualization for representing TF binding motifs, protein amino acid motifs, mutational profiles, with additional applications in phylogenetics and histone modifications. The package can be installed from Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Logolas.html).
